# What is ClubHub?
ClubHub is a student designed app created to cater to clubs and various other school related organizations by creating a hub where school groups, namely clubs can store their content and view on a RokuTV. Designed to lightweight and dynamic, ClubHub interfaces with an online website to upload content to a server that ClubHub utilizes to load content.

# Why was ClubHub created?
ClubHub was developed by students at Santa Teresa High School in collaboration with Roku in a student outreach program during the 2023 summer. Throughout the program, our team learned organizational skills and learned Brightscript/Scenegraph, developed a business plan, and gained experience working in a group work environment.
